# Wino Mail
This repository is created for tracking the issues and feedbacks for Wino Mail, built-in Mail app clone for Windows. I appreciate all kinds of feedback and potential future requests for later. You can message me in [Developer Sanctuary Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/714581497222398064/932666402005987400) (@bkaankose) or send an email to bkaankose {at} outlook {dot} com. Please keep in mind that releases on this repository have bugs and you may experience unwanted behaviors. Don't forget to read release notes for the first public preview release and so on.

# Where is the code?
Wino Mail is in private development for now. You can find the releases, issues and feedbacks from community in this repository. Depending on the community interaction I have plans to open source the code in the later phases of development.
