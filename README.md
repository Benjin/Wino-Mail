# Wino Mail
Native mail client for Windows device families. It's not a web wrapper, but a desktop application written in C#/XAML with UWP.

This repository is for tracking issues only, but I have plans to open-source the application in the future.

## Motivation
I'm a big fan of Windows Mail & Calendars due to it's simplicity. Personally find it more intuative for a daily use cases compared to Outlook desktop. Seeing Microsoft deprecating it and forcing millions of people to use the new Outlook dragged me into start working on Wino couple years ago. Wino's main motivation is to bring all the existing functionality from Mail & Calendars overtime without changing the user experience that millions loved since Windows 8 days in Mail & Calendars.
