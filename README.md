## Wino Mail
Wino is a lightweight mail client for Windows 10/11 that supports Gmail and Outlook accounts. It is still in active development. Main motivation for this project is to replace Mail & Calendar for Windows with modern Windows design without using web technologies for speed. Wino is being developed using UWP and a .NET Standard library for handling mail synchronization.
