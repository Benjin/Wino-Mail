# 🚀 Good job on building Wino Mail from the source 🙂

## Once we finish pre-release testing, I will add the 1.7.0 patch notes here.

### Right now, it's pretty lonely here. 🤷‍♂️

- Make sure you read the contributuion guidelines before you start diving into the code. ⚠️
- You may find some redundant methods, interfaces, classes, etc. that are not used in the project. Please ignore them for now 🥺. I will clean them up in the future. 
- If you want to disable the unlimited account check, go to AccountManagementViewModel.cs and update the Free Account Count property at the top 😁
- If you have any questions, feel free to ask me on [Twitter 🐦](https://twitter.com/TrayhopeR) or project's Discord channels. 
- Good luck! 🍀
